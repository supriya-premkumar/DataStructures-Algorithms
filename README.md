# Interview Prep - Data Structures and Algorithms 

## Arrays:
Arrays is a contiguous blocks of memory used to represent sequence.
An array maps an integers in the range [0,n-1] to objects of given type,
where n represents number of objects in the array/size of an array.
   ### Types:
   * One-dimensional Arrays: Linear Arrays
   * Multi-dimensional Arrays: an array containing more than one or more arrays.
     Has one index per dimension.
         Two dimensional array has two indices to select an element.
         Three dimensional array has three indices to select an element.
   * Dynamic Arrays:
     Support resizing.
   
   | First Header  | Second Header |
   | ------------- | ------------- |
   | Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
   | Content Cell  | Content Cell  |


## Strings:


## Linked Lists:
 Linked List is a type of Data Structure which stores data in the form of nodes,
 each node contains an object and a reference to the next node.
 
                
Big O Efficiency:

* Indexing: Linked Lists: O(n)
* Search: Linked Lists: O(n)
* Optimized Search: Linked Lists: O(n)
* Insertion: Linked Lists: O(1)


## BinaryTree:
Binary Tree is a Data Structure useful for representing hierarchy, where each node can only have two children.

* Left Child (Left Subtree)
* Right Child (Right Subtree)

    ### Perfect Binary:
    A Binary Tree is called `Perfect Binary Tree` when all the leaf nodes are at same depth.

    * The number of nodes doubles at each level as we go down the height of a Perfect Binary Tree.
