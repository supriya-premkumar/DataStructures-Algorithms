# Interview Prep - Data Structures and Algorithms 

## Arrays:

## Strings:

## Linked Lists:
 Linked List is a type of Data Structure which stores data in the form of nodes,
 each node contains an object and a reference to the next node.
                
Big O Efficiency:
                * Indexing: Linked Lists: O(n)
                * Search: Linked Lists: O(n)
                * Optimized Search: Linked Lists: O(n)
                * Insertion: Linked Lists: O(1)


## BinaryTree:
Binary Tree is a Data Structure useful for representing hierarchy, where each node can only have two children.

* Left Child (Left Subtree)
* Right Child (Right Subtree)

    ### Perfect Binary:
    A Binary Tree is called `Perfect Binary Tree` when all the leaf nodes are at same depth.
